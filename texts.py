        This application consists of the automatic prediction of reaction rate constant of the radical-based oxidation process of 
        aqueous and atmospheric organic contaminants based on Machine Learning models using molecular fingerprints. 
        It is only necessary to inform the SMILES or CAS Number format of a specific molecule. 
        The models present in this work were built using scikit-learn and XGBoost packages. 
        The predict values can be confronted with experimental values available in our work or kinetics.nist.gov/solution
